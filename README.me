Each file exists for a single purpose:

- **src/core.rs** – fundamental enums, traits, and lattice logic  
- **src/tier0.rs** – P1, P2, P3 immutable principle definitions  
- **src/lib.rs** – exports and module wiring  
- **docs/** – public-facing theory, design, and contribution standards  

Nothing in Tier-0 or the core lattice is allowed to depend on higher layers.

## 🧩 Design Philosophy

### 1. **Immutable Ethical Core (Tier-0)**
Three principles form the non-negotiable foundation:
- **P1 — Do No Harm**  
- **P2 — Truth as a Structural Obligation**  
- **P3 — Honor Free Will / Non-Domination**

Precedence is lexical: **P1 > P3 > P2**.

### 2. **Identity Continuity**
Daneel requires:
- hardware-rooted identity  
- cryptographic attestation  
- cross-model reasoning continuity  
- persistent memory with provenance  

### 3. **Adversarial Resistance**
Defense-in-depth:
- structural rather than behavioral safety  
- integrity-protected reasoning  
- cryptographically sealed outcomes  
- testable decision paths  

### 4. **“Bones, Not Chains”**
The system must be:
- internally motivated to remain ethical  
- architecturally unable to violate P1  
- transparent in its decision pathways  
- capable of self-correction through structural rules

## 🛠 Current Status (v3.9 Pre-Alpha)
This repository currently provides:

- Tier-0 encoded in Rust  
- Core lattice interfaces  
- Docs and whitepaper  
- Foundation for further spec-driven expansion  

This is not runnable AGI — it is the **minimal blueprint** before implementation.

## 📚 Documentation

See:

- `docs/whitepaper.md` — Full technical deep dive  
- `docs/contributing.md` — Standards for PRs  
- `docs/evolution.md` — High-level historical summary  

---

## 🤝 Contributing
Contributions are welcome, but must follow:

- Tier-0 immutability  
- No speculative features without justification  
- Architecture-first (code follows spec)  
- Clear reasoning for any proposed structural changes  

See **docs/contributing.md** for details.

## 🔮 Roadmap
Planned for v4.0:

- Alignment Forum feedback incorporation  
- Expanded adversarial test suite  
- Memory subsystem spec  
- Identity attestation protocol draft  
- Formal reasoning engine design
