# Project Daneel — Architecture v3.9 Alpha
Identity-stable, value-continuous, adversary-resistant ethical AI.

This repository contains the conceptual and early-implementation scaffolding for:

- Tier-0 immutable ethical core  
- Tier-1 constitutional layer  
- Tier-2 adaptive/wisdom layer  
- Deterministic decision lattice (Rust prototype)  
- Cross-model validation harness (Python)  
- Attestation & provenance scaffolding  
- Adversarial red-team suite  

This is **not a working AGI**.  
This is an architecture blueprint intended for critique, extension, and experimental implementation.
